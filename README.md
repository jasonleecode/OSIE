OSIE (Open Source Industrial Edge) will deliver "Industrial Edge as a Service" (IEaaS), a disruptive cloud service
which transforms industrial automation into a branch of the open source software and hardware ecosystems. OSIE
will cut prices by an order of magnitude, eliminate interoperability blockers, accelerate data-driven business and
provide flexibility for Industry 4.0. It will support real-time orchestration and deterministic, end-to-end
communication at the edge using generic hardware.
